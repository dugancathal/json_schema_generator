# JsonSchemaGenerator

This gem exists to help generate JSON schemas from pre-existing JSON.
My primary use-case for this is to help with "contract" testing and drift.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'json_schema_generator'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install json_schema_generator

## Usage

The surface area of this gem is _very_ small (one method).
You can generate a *ruby*-based schema for some input JSON like so:

```ruby
JsonSchemaGenerator.generate('{"a": 1}') #=> {"type": "object", ...}
```

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bundle install` to install dependencies. 
Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. 
To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
